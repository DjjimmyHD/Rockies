## THE QUESTION ###

- Rockies season is rapidly approaching and regardless of how you feel about the Rockies or baseball, the months April to October can be a nightmare to navigate through downtown Denver if you're unaware or uninformed about simple things. For example did you know the Rockies have 81 home games this year? They span from Friday games at 6:10 pm to Tuesday games at 12:00 pm. I have made a simple site that keeps track of all this for you and asks one question? Where are the Rockies?

### THE ANSWER ###

- I designed an app that allows you to track if the Rockies have a home game today (today being whatever day you are using the app). The app will also tell you who the Rockies are playing as well as what time they are playing. If the Rockies aren't home it will also tell you where the away game is being played.
