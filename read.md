### Goals ###
 - At the core I want to be able to create a website that answers the simple question, "is there a rockies game today"
 - I want to be provide an easy to read answer to the question with maybe a few extra pieces of information
  - was there a game?
  - when is the next game?
  - when is the next home game?
  - what can I do in Denver before the game?
  - what can I do in Denver after the game?
  - are there other events happening before, during or after the game?
  - what is traffic like?
  - what is the light rail schedule?
  - is there relevant rockies news?
  - if I get there early do I get cool shit?

### CODE NOTES ###
- The api I am using gave me the code to get data I need now I need to start manipulating it
  - It came in long form and I am just going to leave it as is for now
  - I am going to change .done to .then and .fail to .catch
- I will start by seeing if I can just get the schedule for the whole 2017 season
- I have the schedule and I changed the .done and .fail
- The schedule is being logged as data with [2430] arrays
- I want to build a loop to sort through all rockies games then separate those by rockies home games vs rockies away games
  - Side note I am unsure if I can still call data after the ajax request but I am pretty sure using .then will allow me to do it with out returning
- colorado codes
  - AwayTeamID: 23
  - HomeTeamID: 23
  - AwayTeam: COL
  - HomeTeam: COL
  - StadiumID: 44
- Ok I was able to access the first object at index 0 and log it
- Now I want to create a loop that goes through and creates two separate arrays
  - one i want to sort by AwayTeam: COL
  - one I want to sort by HomeTeam: COL
- Got the loops working to sort out the home and away schedule
  - I sorted by stadiumID and AwayTeamID
- I annotated where the code is I think I am just going to comment out my console logs that way I know where they are and that the code was working on each step
- I dont want to just display all the scheduled home games, I want to have a way to when a button is clicked or when the page is loaded, I check the current day with the array of home games and then I pull out a few things
  - things I want to grab from the homeList
    - who the rockies are playing
    - what time the rockies are playing
- This will involve making editing my html so I am going to make my first commit here
///FIRST COMMIT///
- I am going to edit the index so I can start pushing the data to a web page
- Messed around the index so I can see how I am going to get the current date. It is a jquery function that just needs to be pieced together
- Going to make another commit so I can see what I did in case something breaks later on
